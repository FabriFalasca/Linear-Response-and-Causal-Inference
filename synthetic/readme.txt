The main code to infer causality from time series is shown in notebook main.ipynb

In notebook explaining.ipynb we show and explain each step of the causal inference framework.

The dimensionality reduction step is instead shown in the application folder "Global_SST". The dimensionality reduction step in "Global_SST" plus the causal inference step shown here in the case of a simple system make up the framework proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14433.pdf
